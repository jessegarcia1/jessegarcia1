### Hello!!!

My name is Jesse and thanks for finding my GitHub! I am a software developer working on learning more about the industry and just trying to have fun with the work I do.

My favorite project so far is the one titled 'doot' (incredible name I know) because I worked with a medical practice based in New York to help reduce the time it takes for them to file their insurace reports! It is my first full stack application that uses Typescript/React for the frontend and express for the backed. There were a lot of hoops I had to jump through to make it work, but those struggles come with any project. It was a blast being able to trouble shoot the problems I had along the way, because I knew with every solved problem I was just learning more.

I am also an avid Magic the Gathering player, and I love weightlifting too. I need to balance out all the sitting I do somehow!

Thanks for taking a stop by my profile and feel free to reach out to jessegarca5@gmail.com if you have any questions (it is spelt 'garca' because 'garcia' was taken). 

I would love to chat!
